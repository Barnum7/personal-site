Isaac Asimov was one of the most prolific writers who ever lived. Publishing over 500 books, and approximately 90,000 letters over the course of his life.

Below are a collection of some of his tips on living a prolific life.

On Scheduling

> I am still and forever in the candy store. Of course, I'm not taking money and making change; I'm not forced to be polite to everyone who comes in (in
> actual fact, I was never very good at that). I am, instead, doing things I very much want to do - but the schedule is there; the schedule that was ground  
> into me; the schedule you would think I would have rebelled against once I had the chance

Asimov was the son of Russian-immigrant parents. These parents taught him the value of entrepreneurship and long work days.

His father bought a small candy store and required Isaac and the rest of the family to work. Long, grueling hours to keep the business afloat.

For the rest of his adult life Asimov would praise the Candy Store for teaching him the power of a full schedule. And of how much you can get done by putting in a full-day's work.

On Finding Ideas

> With a drive that's hyperspatial, through the parsecs will race, ad you'll find plotting is a breeze,

> - The Foundation of S.F. Success, Isaac Asimov


Asimov was a student of history. He used this knowledge in his famous Foundation Series. Using as a framework Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire".

Asimov knew that human struggles and social structures repeat themselves. So he consulted history looking for exciting characters and trials to repeat in his own work. Asimov always believed that a future empire would behave very much like a past empire.

    By thinking and thinking and thinking till I'm ready to kill myself.

    - Asimov, when asked how he comes up with new ideas


Even with his frequent historical consultations, Asimov sometimes came up dry.

When this happened he sat down and got thinking. He came up with more ideas than anyone around him, because he thought harder than anyone around him.

Confidence

    Well, if I couldn't, I wasn't Isaac Asimov


Asimov was once asked by an editor to take on a complex writing assignment. 

The assignment was expanding a short story about a collapsing universe into a novel.

And to explain this collapse from the perspective of two different mirror worlds. Juggling three worlds in a single narrative.

Other writers would have backed down. Asimov, would not. He knew that if he couldn't pull this off, he wasn't worth his acquired fame.

    So what if it limps. Its purpose is to get you into the next stage of the story and you take off from there. Time enough when you go through the novel again to correct the transition. For all you know, the material that you will write much later in the nivel will make it plain to you exactly how the transition ought to have been. No amount of rewriting and repolishing now will get it right in the absence of knowledge of the course of the entire book. So let it limp and get on with it ...

    Think of yourself as an artist making a sketch to get the composition clear in his mind, the blocks of color, the balance, and the rest. With that done, you can worry about the fine points.

    - Asimov's advice, in a letter about "limping transitions" in a first draft


Asimov felt that authors tried too hard to be perfectionists. And this only got in the way of them being prolific.

Get the story on the page. If a transition limps, let it limp. Editing is an editor's job.

A writer's job is to write.

Mortality

    I was in a hurry, for despite everything I couldn't rid myself of the feeling that I was mortal.


Asimov wrote like a man running out of time.

He didn't have time to stop. He knew he was going to die, and he refused to allow that to happen before putting everything in his head on the page.
